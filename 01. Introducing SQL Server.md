# 1 Introducing SQL Server

This chapter covers

* What you should know about this book
* The SQL Server index mistake (mistake #0)
* The C4 model
* SQL Server’s components, protocols, and platforms
* The importance of SQL Server skills

Over recent years, *DBA* has become a catchall term to describe anybody who works with databases. I always feel that this is doing something of a disservice to both the technology and the professionals who work with it. SQL Server is a massive product, and complex data-tier applications require teams to have a range of competencies to harness its full power. Therefore, when we refer to DBA in this book, we will be referring specifically to database administrators.

We will cover topics relevant to people with the following roles:

* Database administrators (DBAs)
* Database developers
* Extract, transform, load (ETL) engineers

This book may also be of interest to members of the following communities if they have overlapping responsibilities:

* Database architects
* Data warehouse developers
* Testers
* Data scientists
* Cyber security engineers
* Business intelligence developers

## 1.1 The SQL Server index mistake (mistake #0)

The modern SQL Server ecosystem is large and complex, which leads me nicely to mistake #0—terminology that I have borrowed from virology, where the index case (or case 0) describes the first patient to contract a virus and infect other people. In this context, it is the root of all other SQL Server mistakes. This mistake is not usually made by database professionals. Instead, it is generally made by solution architects, delivery managers, program managers, and business analysts. It can be summed up in a single quote—a quote that I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard it: “But it’s just a database, right?”

This assumption of simplicity leads to an incredible number of projects not budgeting for the resources to develop a suitable data-tier application or factoring in enough time to sufficiently develop such an application. It leads to due consideration not being given to the postproject operational support of the environment, and it leads to the term *DBA* being used to describe anybody who works with databases, regardless of their competencies.

How are these problems addressed? Welcome the “accidental DBA,” a person who has a limited amount of experience in SQL Server, often because they are an application developer who has created some small databases as a backend data store in the past. Suddenly, this person is responsible for the development, optimization, administration, and security posture of all things SQL Server related.

Does this scenario sound familiar? If so, then it is certainly worth reading on, as this book will explore the common mistakes made by database professionals who are finding their feet, many of whom fall into the accidental DBA camp.

In this book, we will discuss mistakes that are made by people performing tasks related to development, administration, high availability (HA), disaster recovery (DR), and security.

## 1.2 An overview of SQL Server

SQL Server is a leading *relational database management system (RDBMS)* produced by Microsoft. In its simplest form, it provides a platform for hosting and managing databases. It also has many other features that allow for advanced activities, such as reporting, data transformation, and master data management.

To understand the breadth of SQL Server a little better, let’s imagine the use case of a confectionary company called MagicChoc. It has a website, hosted in the public cloud, which sells its chocolatey goodness. It also has a small data center in its factory, which hosts its manufacturing application, stock control application, and reporting solution. This is illustrated in the system landscape diagram in figure 1.1.

**Figure 1.1 MagicChoc system landscape diagram**

C4 model

In addition to technical diagrams in this book, we will also make use of the C4 model, where appropriate. The C4 model is a set of architectural standard diagrams. At its core, C4 contains four standard diagrams: a system context diagram, a container diagram, a component diagram, and a code diagram. The system context diagram is at the highest level, illustrating an application’s interfaces with users and other applications. Each subsequent level drills through a specific area of the application, providing ever more granular detail. The lowest level of granularity is the code diagram at the bottom.

The model also contains side diagrams: a system landscape diagram, which illustrates how a portfolio of applications interacts; a dynamic diagram, which illustrates how static elements work together at run time to form a feature; and a final diagram, which is a deployment diagram and illustrates the platform that an application is deployed on.

> [!TIP]
>
> While a full discussion of C4 is beyond the scope of this book, a full description can be found at <https://c4model.com>.

The interesting part of this system landscape is that all four of the applications have a SQL Server component. The MagicChoc website is hosted in Azure and has an Azure SQL Database storing information in the backend. The stock inventory system and the manufacturing application both have SQL Server databases, and these databases are hosted on the same SQL Server instance, which runs on a virtual machine in the data center. The company reporting tool consists of a data warehouse, hosted in the data center, but it also uses SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) as the front end and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to produce multidimensional data models. It also uses SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to pull data from the other applications and transform it into a denormalized structure, optimized for reporting.

Let’s zoom in and examine a container diagram that focuses on the reporting application. This diagram is shown in figure 1.2 and allows us to start seeing the breadth of the SQL Server stack.

> [!NOTE]
>
> C4 diagrams should always be used appropriately, and you should pick and mix the most appropriate diagrams for any given scenario. In this chapter, the system landscape diagram and the container diagram are the most appropriate to illustrate the scenario, but we will be using other C4 diagrams throughout the book.

You can see how the reporting application actually uses multiple SQL Server components to serve the business requirements, as well as databases that sit alongside the data warehouse and enable the functionality of those components. A full list of the major components of SQL Server 2022 is given in table 1.1.

Table 1.1 SQL server major components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Analysis Services (SSAS) | Allows for the creation and hosting of multidimensional data models and tabular data models that can be used for advanced reporting |
| Azure Connected Services | Supports tight integration between Azure and SQL Server hosted on-premises. This includes the ability to easily integrate on-premises hosted SQL Server instances with Azure features such as Synapse, Purview, and Microsoft Defender. Additionally, the simple Azure Arc connection can be configured during instance installation. This allows a single view of SQL Server installations across multicloud and on-premises, and fully automated technical assessments. |
| Database Engine | The core database management service, which allows for relational databases to be built and hosted. It includes second-tier operating system components for managing memory and processor resources. It also incorporates data security, high-availability technologies, data replication, integrations with heterogeneous data sources, and support for semistructured data, such as XML and JSON. |
| *Data Quality Services (DQS)* | A data quality solution that provides a knowledge base to support critical data quality tasks, such as standardization and deduplication. The DQS Server component comprises data quality functionality and storage, while the Data Quality Client component provides a graphical user interface that can be used by data domain experts. |
| Data Virtualization with PolyBase | Allows developers to use T-SQL to query external data sources, such as Azure Blob, Delta Tables (the default table format in Azure Databricks), Hadoop, MongoDB, Oracle, S3, and Teradata |
| Integration Services (SSIS) | Provides versatile ETL operations. Often used to pull data from heterogeneous sources, denormalize the data, and populate data warehouses. Also used to integrate data from external sources, such as web services and FTP sites, into SQL Server databases. |
| Machine Learning Services (In-Database) | Allows developers to use R and Python scripts inside databases. These scripts can be used to prepare data for machine learning or to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. |
| Master Data Services (MDS) | A Master Data Management (MDM) solution that allows data stewards to manage a company’s master data. Stewards can create data models and rules. Master data can also be exported so that it can be easily shared with business stakeholders. |
| Reporting Services (SSRS) | Provides users with a graphical reporting tool. Reports can contain tabular data, as well as charts, maps, and other graphical elements. The reports can be complex, and there is support for parameters, variables, linked reports, and report caching. |

As you can see, SQL Server is a vast and complex product, which can and does span many volumes. Therefore, in this book, we will focus mainly on the Database Engine, although we will also touch on cloud integration and SSIS. Therefore, let’s dive a little deeper into the Database Engine.

### 1.2.1 Overview of the Database Engine

To explain the Database Engine, let’s explore the journey a query takes when it is executed by a user. Let’s imagine that a MagicChoc customer is exploring the website and decides to look more closely at the LushBar chocolate bar. The website runs the following query, which reads the `dbo.Products` table and returns the name and description of the product, alongside the product image. The `CASE` statement is used to return an appropriate response, depending on the quantity of the product in stock. If there are more than 10 in stock, it will return the text “In Stock.” If there are 0, then it will return the text “Out of stock.” If there are between 1 and 10 of the product in stock, it will build a string that informs the user of exactly how many are in stock:

```sql
SELECT
      ProductName
    , ProductDescription AS Description
    , CASE
        WHEN StockQty >= 10
            THEN N'In Stock'
        WHEN StockQty > 0 AND StockQty < 10
            THEN CAST(StockQty AS NVARCHAR) + ' left in stock'
        ELSE 'Out of stock'
      END
    , ProductImage
FROM dbo.Products WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
```

NOTE Using `NOLOCK` in this context is a mistake that we will discuss in chapter 5.

The journey of this query is depicted in figure 1.3. In this diagram, notice that the user interacts with SQL Server using the Tabular Data Streams application layer protocol. SQL Server receives this data via SNI, which is part of SQL Server’s protocol layer. The protocol layer then sends the request to the relational engine.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437401/files/OEBPS/Images/CH01_F03_Carter.png)<br>
**Figure 1.3 The flow of a query through the Database Engine**

Here, the query is parsed. If you have made a mistake in the syntax of your query, the parser is the component that will cause an error to be thrown. This process not only checks the validity of query syntax but also includes algebraization, a process that converts object names into object IDs. This results in the creation of a highly normalized query tree, which is passed to the Query Optimizer.

The Query Optimizer is a highly sophisticated process that sits right at the heart of the SQL Server. The difference between SQL and many other languages, such as C or BASIC, is that SQL is a descriptive language, rather than a prescriptive language. In prescriptive languages, a developer specifies exactly what they want the language to do. In a descriptive language like SQL, however, the developer simply describes the results that they want to return. The Query Optimizer is responsible for determining the most efficient way of returning the desired result set. As you can imagine, this will have a huge effect on the performance of the Database Engine. Therefore, the optimizer uses object types, data types, and statistics, among other metadata, to describe the data in columns and indexes, to assess the cost of various plans. Although the optimizer is an incredible component, it is no substitute for well-written code. You can help the optimizer help you by ensuring you do not fall into T-SQL development pitfalls, such as using cursors, which we will discuss in chapters 5 and 9. Another mistake that can hinder the optimizer is failing to keep your statistics and indexes maintained. We will explore this in chapter 11.

> [!TIP]
>
> SQL Server 2022 can also use *optimizer feedback*. This uses the Query Store and intelligent query processing to optimize aspects of the query plan, such as the memory grants and the maximum degree of parallelism, based on the performance of a given query over time. This will be discussed further in chapter 10.

Once a suitable plan has been established, the plan is sent to the *Query Executor*. This component will interact with the storage engine to read (or write) the required data. This involves the *Transaction Manager*, which is responsible for managing and distributing the results of an atomic transaction. Even though our query has not been run in the context of an explicit transaction, it will still be inside an implicit transaction. The performance of your transactions can be affected if you have chosen a suboptimal transaction isolation level, which we will discuss in chapter 10. *Lock Manager* is responsible for locking objects to ensure transactional consistency. In the case of our query, it is possible to read rows that are never committed, because we have used the `NOLOCK` query hint. We will discuss this further in chapter 5. The *Buffer Manager* is the component that interacts with the cached data in memory.

Three areas of cache are depicted in figure 1.3. The *plan cache* stores complex query plans, meaning that subsequent invocations of the query may be able to avoid the optimization process. The *log cache* caches transaction log records before they are flushed to disk.

> [!TIP]
>
> The log records are always flushed to disk before a transaction is committed unless delayed durability is used.

The *buffer cache* stores data pages that have been read from a disk. It is important to note that a query is always satisfied from the cache and never directly from data stored on disk. Even if the required data pages do not reside in cache, they will be read from the disk into the cache, and then the query will be satisfied from the cached data. A common mistake is to return more data in a query than you need. If you do this, then the buffer cache will fill up quicker than it needs to. This will result in older data being released from the cache sooner. In turn, this can lead to poor performance, as data needs to be read from disk more often. We will discuss this more in chapter 4.

### 1.2.2 Heterogeneous platforms

It is important to remember that SQL Server is no longer just “a database on Windows.” Instead, it is supported on a veritable smorgasbord of platforms. First, let us consider the operating systems on which SQL Server 2022 is supported. These operating systems are laid out in figure 1.4.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437401/files/OEBPS/Images/CH01_F04_Carter.png)<br>
**Figure 1.4 Operating systems supported by SQL Server**

> [!NOTE]
>
> SQL Server Express edition and Standard edition can also be installed on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

You will notice that not only can SQL Server be installed on *Windows Server Core*, which is a PowerShell-only version of Windows that does not have a GUI, but it can also be installed on three different flavors of Linux. This means that there is potential for a database professional to work not only with the GUI but also with PowerShell and Bash.

It is also worth discussing the hosts that SQL Server 2022 can be installed on, which are depicted in figure 1.5.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781633437401/files/OEBPS/Images/CH01_F05_Carter.png)<br>
**Figure 1.5 Hosts supported by SQL Server**

Official support for SQL Server on VMware has been around for some time. What may be more surprising is that recent versions of SQL Server are also supported on containers. This means that some database professionals may need to be familiar with technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> At the time of writing, SQL Server is only supported on Linux containers. SQL Server on Windows containers was available in beta, but this program has since been canceled. There is nothing stopping you from creating your own Windows containers hosting SQL Server, based on a vanilla Windows Core container image. Just note that as it is unsupported, you should never do this in a production environment.

We should also consider cloud support for SQL Server. SQL Server is supported on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) virtual machines in the cloud. These are called Azure Virtual Machines in Azure and GCP or EC2 instances in AWS. There are also PaaS offerings from these vendors, however.

In AWS, Application Machine Images (AMIs) are available that have SQL Server installed. Depending on the AMI used, you can purchase SQL Server with the EC2 instance on a Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA). In this model, the license is included in the hourly cost of the EC2 instance. Alternatively, you can bring your own license (provided that this is within the terms of your license agreement with Microsoft).

There is also an option to use RDS, which is a Database as a Service (DBaaS) offering. The underlying server and SQL Server instance are managed by AWS, and you are only responsible for managing the databases hosted within it.

In Azure, you can create SQL Server VMs from Azure VM images that have SQL Server installed. Like AWS, you can use a license-included model, where the cost of the SQL Server license is included in the cost of the VM, allowing you to pay as you go. You can also use the Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) license model, which allows you to use an existing SQL Server license. Finally, in Azure, an HA/DR license can be used to host a SQL Server replica that is used exclusively for HA or DR purposes.

Azure offers *Azure SQL Database*, which is a DBaaS offering, similar to the AWS RDS hosting option. Additionally, there is a SQL Instance as a Service offering called Azure SQL Managed Instance. This option provides a balance between a VM and a DBaaS by offering users the option of managing their own SQL Server instance, while the underlying operating system and virtual machine are managed by Azure.

Finally, Azure offers Azure SQL Edge, which provides an Internet of Things (IoT) database that includes data streaming and data processing.

## 1.3 Why we should still care about SQL Server

In recent years, I have heard people question if we should still care about SQL Server. This is usually for one of two reasons. The first is because of an assumption that relational databases are not really required anymore because everything uses NoSQL.

This assumption is not really correct. While NoSQL has certainly grown massively over the last decade and is the correct choice for many use cases around data analytics, the reality is that there is still very much a place for relational databases. It simply boils down to the old adage “Never put a square peg in a round hole!” Simply put, you should always use the right tool for the job. Trying to force a dataset that is a natural fit for a relational database into an unstructured environment is as bad as trying to force naturally unstructured data into a SQL Server database.

The second reason is an assumption that DBaaS means that you simply don’t need to run your own SQL Servers anymore; hence, there is no need for SQL Server skills.

Again, this assumption is not really correct. DBaaS and managed instances are very helpful tools in the toolbelt of any database professional. They do not eliminate the need for SQL Server skills, however. This is for two reasons. The first reason is that even databases hosted in DBaaS need to be developed and have their code optimized to avoid poor performance. The second reason is that DBaaS or even managed instances are not always a good choice. Sometimes they are not even feasible for a given workload. While there are several reasons for this, one common reason is cost. You are paying your cloud provider to host, patch, secure, and optimize all layers of the stack below the database. This comes at a premium. If you move every single database to an RDS or Azure SQL Database, then you may be able to offset this cost against the cost of your physical DBA team. If there are reasons why you cannot move all of your databases to a DBaaS offering, however, then you will end up double paying.

Physical DBAs vs. logical DBAs

*Physical DBA* is a term used to describe DBAs who have good knowledge of managing SQL Server instances but are not skilled in the database tier. This is opposed to logical DBAs, who are skilled at developing and tuning databases but do not have experience with managing instances.

I have seen companies structure their database teams in this way when they have an infrastructure-managed service provider who builds and supports SQL Server instances and ensures they are available. Often, they then hand over responsibility for the databases to an in-house application support team who are responsible for the support and optimization of database-level constructs.

In my experience, it is almost always the case that you simply cannot move all of your databases to a DBaaS offering. One reason for this is vendor support. If you run a commercial off-the-shelf product that has a SQL Server backend, then you are at the mercy of the vendor agreeing to support the product if the backend is moved to a DBaaS.

Another reason is that many companies have large, complex data-tier applications, sometimes with hundreds of thousands of lines of code embedded in components such as SQL Server Integration Services. These can often not simply be *lifted and shifted*, which is a term used to describe migrating a data-tier application as is, without any transformation or modernization. Instead, they require re-architecture—and that means a significant investment of both time and expenditure, which often cannot be justified.

## 1.4 Why getting SQL Server right matters

In my youth, I used to play a board game called Othello. The tag line for the game was “A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.” SQL Server always reminds me of this. One of the advantages of SQL Server over some of its rivals is that it is very easy to implement. It is, however, very difficult to implement well.

This matters because a poorly implemented SQL Server instance can lead to problems, including

* Poor performance
* Data theft
* Ransomware attacks
* Noncompliance with regulation
* Loss of data in the event of a disaster
* Prolonged outage in the event of a disaster

Poorly implemented database code can lead to

* Poor performance
* Security breaches
* Unhandled failures
* Code that can’t be maintained

These problems can lead to companies experiencing vast expenses, loss of revenue, loss of reputation, increased staff turnover, or even prosecution. Therefore, getting SQL Server right really does matter.

## Summary
